# Hey there, I'm @Chrischdian 👋

- 👀 I'm interested in civil engineering, infrastructure tech, and digital tools that make life easier.
- 🌱 I'm currently learning more about automation with VBA, SQL magic, and playing around with Python on the side.
- 💞️ I'm looking to collaborate on anything that bridges the gap between engineering and code — let’s build clever stuff!
- 📫 How to reach me: Just drop a message here on GitHub or send a pigeon.
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I can debug Excel formulas faster than most people can find the "=" key.
